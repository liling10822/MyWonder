# MyWonder's documentation


## The project summary
MyWonder is a new platform for big data analysis and visualization. In MyWonder, the users can easily create visualizations of massive files within 10 minutes, which is achieved by distributing the files on the cloud.
For the users who are inconvenient with a computer, our mobile client is easy and fast to use for calculations and summaries.
